# KeyGenerator
Created originally to generate safe IOTA seeds, however, useful for creating passwords/keys/seeds of various types.
This program utilises a quantum random number generator (the Australian National University's quantum random number API) to generate keys/passwords/seeds that, Man-In-The-Middle attacks asside, should be cryptographically safe.

Both MATLAB files (Random_Keypass_Generator.m and RandKeyGen.m) should be downloaded for ease-of-use. Random_Keypass_Generator.m contains inputs that are used to call RandKeyGen.m.
